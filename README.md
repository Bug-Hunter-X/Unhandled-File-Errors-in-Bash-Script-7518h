This repository demonstrates a common error in bash scripting: not handling file existence properly before attempting to process it.  The `bug.sh` script shows the incorrect approach which might lead to unexpected behavior or script failure if the input file is missing.  The solution, `bugSolution.sh`, illustrates how to correctly check for file existence and handle potential errors gracefully.
